# Theme Documentation

This is where you can place documentation for your theme.

Markdown files in the `editors` directory will be parsed and displayed in the
admin panel. This is a great place to explain how to use your theme, what
features it has, and any other information that might be useful to the
WordPress users. Place images in the `images` directory and link to them in the
markdown files. Use relative links.

Markdown files in the `developers` directory will be parsed and displayed in
the admin panel for administrators only. This is a great place to write
documentation for yourself in the future or any other developers that might
work on the theme. Place images in the `images` directory and link to them in the
markdown files. Use relative links.

_Note_: You need to keep the table of contents in `developers/_index.md` and
`editors/_index.md` up to date manually.
