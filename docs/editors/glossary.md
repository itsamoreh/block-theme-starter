## Block

A block is a self-contained unit of content that can be used to build a page or
post. Blocks can be added to a page or post using the block inserter, which is
accessed by clicking the `+` icon in the top left corner of the editor.

## Block Pattern

A block pattern is a collection of blocks that have been pre-configured to
create a specific layout. Block patterns can be added to a page or post using
the block inserter, which is accessed by clicking the `+` icon in the top left
corner of the editor. Once a block pattern is added to a page, it stands alone.
You can edit it however you want.
