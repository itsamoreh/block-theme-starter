## Block Pattern

A block pattern is a collection of blocks that have been pre-configured to create a specific layout. Block patterns can be added to a page or post using the block inserter, which is accessed by clicking the `+` icon in the top left corner of the editor. Once a block pattern is added to a page, it stands alone. You can edit it however you want.

## Favicon

The site favicon is the small icon that appears in the browser tab when you visit a website. It is also used as the app icon when you save a website to your home screen on a mobile device. The favicon can be set in [the Customizer](/wp-admin/customize.php?autofocus[section]=title_tagline).

## Templates

WordPress templates are pre-designed layouts used to display content on a WordPress website. They can be customized to control the appearance and functionality of a website, including the placement of widgets, menus, and other page elements. You can pick a template for a page or post using the Template dropdown in the Document sidebar.
