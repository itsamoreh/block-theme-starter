# BTS Editor Help

## Getting Started

BTS is a WordPress block theme.

Pages and posts, page templates, even the header and footer are all built using blocks and block patterns. This theme includes a number of block patterns and custom blocks that you can use in conjunction with WordPress's core blocks to build your site.

For a quick introduction to the block editor, check out the [Gutenberg Demo](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/).
