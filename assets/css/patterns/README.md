# Block Pattern CSS

Add CSS for Block Patterns here. Each CSS file should be scoped to a single
block pattern.

Example - `example-block-pattern.css` would be the file name for a pattern
named `example-block-pattern`. All CSS in this file should be scoped under
the class `.bts-example-block-pattern`.

Make sure to add the class to the pattern's wrapper element in the php file.
